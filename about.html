					So this is my first post. I haven’t gotten down to making this thing live yet but once I get to Berkeley I probably will. My name is Jessica Chang and I’ll be attending Berkeley this fall as an intended CS Major. I know a bit of Java, and I’m using this summer to hone some of my Python, CSS, HTML, and hopefully PHP and API skittlez! I love technology and always love to learn more. My philosophy is that I should enjoy life while I’m young even if it means spendin up all dat work study money :D while of course keeping up my grades and my passions for what I love to do. Some of my hobbies include coding, graphic designing, and watching TV….very limited yes I know but I’m definitely going to try some exotic things this Fall.
					<br /><br />
					Why did I decide to have a blog?
					<br /><br />
					<ol>
						<li>I hope to improve my writing skills obviously. Oftentimes I just feel as though my thought process were linear. For example, I have a million thoughts zooming through my mind but if I want to express them, they all come out slowly, in a line.
						<br /><br />
						<li>I may come off as cocky or arrogant sometimes and I feel like I need to become more open-minded. I really want to become a better person, meet new people, and just become a more likable person in general.
						<br /><br />
						<li>I hope to learn some PHP in the process of managing my blog. I’m an intended CS major but that’s not the point. I love coding–anything. Yes, that includes CSS and HTML you haters!!!! >P
						<br /><br />
						<li>I want to learn more. The world is such an incredible place but there is such limited time to explore everything. Meanwhile, engineers are coming up with more and more gadgets and gizmos and I want to accumulate as much information as possible while having fun of course! This will be kind of like a place of reflection–a place where I can jot down what I’ve learned and reflect on how I’ve applied concepts.
						<br /><br />
						<li />I want people to learn from me. That is–if there is anything to learn from me. :]
						<br /><br />
						<li />I know all of these reasons may not be original but every idea is formed from a piece of inspiration, yeah?
						<br /><br />
						So there you have it. My own blog. My first post. A break from Tumblr (and Tumblr drama). I’m super extremely excited!
